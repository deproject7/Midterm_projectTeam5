Blockchain Based Fraud Detection of Cross Border Payments

Blockchain-based cross-border transactions are highly vulnerable to fraud due to anonymity, high transaction speeds, and lack of central oversight, making it difficult to detect suspicious activities in real time. Traditional fraud detection methods fail to keep up with rapidly evolving fraud tactics, leading to financial losses, regulatory non-compliance, and increased risks for businesses.

Proposed solution using AWS services:
